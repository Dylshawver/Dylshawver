w                     # current logged in with more
ctrl + l OR clear     # clears the screen
netstat               # shows network connections to computer
history               # shows previous commands
sudo !!               # will run last command as sudo
ls -l[isa]            # list out directories
ls --help             # is gonna give basic options not a whole MAN page
cat                   # concatenate, combines files also reads them
MAN                   # gives pages among pages of how to use commands
2 > /dev/null         # removes all errors from command and shows you what ran successfully only
>                     # overwrite output of commmand to file or other destination
>>                    # appends output of commmand to file or other destination
grep                  # grab regular expression
|                     # tells to do something THEN do another (example: ls -lisa /etc | grep syslog)
;                     # has 
*                     # anything or wildcard, fill in 
where                 # locates the binary to run command
egrep                 # gives access to extended library past 
-r                    # recursive
awk                   # lets you reformat or select sections of text based on delimiters on the fly. awk is commonly used to create tabular data sets form comand output in bash.
#XYZ additional notes for awk
sed                   # very powerful tool can be used to replace items in
