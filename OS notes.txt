WINDOWS POWERSHELL






Linux Notes *most of course* (CaSe SeNsItIvE)

Basic commands:
pwd                   # print working directory
whoami                # current logged on user
w                     # current logged in with more
ctrl + l OR clear     # clears the screen
netstat               # shows network connections to computer
history               # shows previous commands
sudo !!               # will run last command as sudo
ls -l[isa]            # list out directories
ls --help             # is gonna give basic options not a whole MAN page
cat                   # concatenate, combines files also reads them
MAN                   # gives pages among pages of how to use commands
2 > /dev/null         # removes all errors from command and shows you what ran successfully only
>                     # overwrite output of commmand to file or other destination
>>                    # appends output of commmand to file or other destination
grep                  # grab regular expression
|                     # tells to do something THEN do another (example: ls -lisa /etc | grep syslog)
;                     # has 
*                     # anything or wildcard, fill in 
where                 # locates the binary to run command
egrep                 # gives access to extended library past 
-r                    # recursive
awk                   # lets you reformat or select sections of text based on delimiters on the fly. awk is commonly used to create tabular data sets form comand output in bash.
#XYZ additional notes for awk
sed                   # very powerful tool can be used to replace items in 

FILE TYPES
- regular file (text, binary)
d directory (folder)
l symbolic link (pointer to another file)
c character device (raw input devices like keyboard, mouse)
b block device (storage device like hard disk)
p named pipe (specific ipc files)
s socket (allows communication between processes)


HASHING:
md5sum [filename]
sha256sum [filename]
for strings:
echo -n "string" | sha512sum

MAN PAGES:
man pages are stored @ /usr/share/man/man<section>/<command>.<Section>.gz
example: /usr/share/man/man1/cat.1.gz
man -w cat             # to find where a man page is for a command in the file system, so this gives the path of the man page for the command "cat" 
result: /usr/share/man/man1/cat.1.gz
man -k digest          # gives all hashes availible for 

Permissions:(Yugio)

VARIBLES
varibles all start with $ then the name, varible names must be XYZ
example a="100"
echo $a
result: 100

$PATH                 # 



IMPORTANT FILES/DIRECTORIES
/etc/passwd    #   7fields    username:passplaceholder:UID:GID: 
/etc                  # everything configurable 

FIREWALL RULES
iptables -L            # list current firewall rules
