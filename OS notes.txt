WINDOWS POWERSHELL






Linux Notes *most of course* (CaSe SeNsItIvE)

Basic commands:
pwd                   # print working directory
whoami                # current logged on user
w                     # current logged in with more
ctrl + l OR clear     # clears the screen
netstat               # shows network connections to computer
history               # shows previous commands
sudo !!               # will run last command as sudo
ls -l[isa]            # list out directories
ls --help             # is gonna give basic options not a whole MAN page
cat                   # concatenate, combines files also reads them
MAN                   # gives pages among pages of how to use commands
2 > /dev/null         # removes all errors from command and shows you what ran successfully only
>                     # overwrite output of commmand to file or other destination
>>                    # appends output of commmand to file or other destination
grep  -v (not grep/exclude)                # grab regular expression
|                     # tells to do something THEN do another (example: ls -lisa /etc | grep syslog)
;                     # has 
*                     # anything or wildcard, fill in 
where                 # locates the binary to run command
egrep                 # gives access to extended library past 
-r                    # recursive
awk                   # lets you reformat or select sections of text based on delimiters on the fly. awk is commonly used to create tabular data sets form comand output in bash.
awk '{print}' <filename>    #prints all lines of file
awk 'NR <=100' <filename>         #prints the first 100 lines
awk 'NR <= 50 || NR >= 70' <filename>      #prints lines less than or equal to 50 and greater than or equal to 70
awk 'NR >= 50 && NR <= 70' <filename>      #prints lines 50 through 70



#XYZ additional notes for awk



sed                   # very powerful tool can be used to replace items in 
find / -type [file|d] <name of file or directory>             # this will search through the whole file system for something specific
ls -l /location to search | grep '^d' | grep '\.d$' | wc -l # the ^ in regex is start of line looking for only directories, the $ is end of line looking for .d which the . is \ or escaped for literal . not wildcard . like regex
valid and invalid ips : grep -E '^[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}$' file

mac address that start with a 0 or even numbers for the first Byte are locally administered or globally administered



FILE TYPES
- regular file (text, binary)
d directory (folder)
l symbolic link (pointer to another file)
c character device (raw input devices like keyboard, mouse)
b block device (storage device like hard disk)
p named pipe (specific ipc files)
s socket (allows communication between processes)


HASHING:
$1$    md5sum [filename]
$5$        sha256sum [filename]
$6$        sha512sum [filename]
for strings:
echo -n "string" | sha512sum
for hashed passwords


MAN PAGES:
man pages are stored @ /usr/share/man/man<section>/<command>.<Section>.gz
example: /usr/share/man/man1/cat.1.gz
man -w cat             # to find where a man page is for a command in the file system, so this gives the path of the man page for the command "cat" 
result: /usr/share/man/man1/cat.1.gz
man -k digest          # gives all hashes availible for 

Permissions:(Yugio)

LOOPS:
while

openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -d -in <file> -out <file>.txt -pass pass:"encryptionkeypassword"

VARIBLES
varibles all start with $ then the name, varible names must be XYZ
example a="100"
echo $a
result: 100

$PATH                 # 



IMPORTANT FILES/DIRECTORIES
/etc/passwd    #   7fields    username: password placeholder: UID: GID: comments: home directory: login shellg
/etc                  # everything configurable 

/etc/group            # group name: password placeholder (usually x): group ID: members of group
